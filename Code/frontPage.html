                can apply for the service, complete it and recieve the payment. Services can vary depending on 
                what the user needs. Services need to be completed inside a limited timeframe. Both sides 
                will need to cooperate with one another so they can get the service <b>completed</b>. </p>

            <p>The button Request Completion is implemented so both pairs work together in order 
               for their service to be completed . If one or another pair have a problem , they 
               need to solve it together . If they go in through a problem which is far bigger than
               they can handle then the problem goes through our other feature .

            <h3>SECURITY</h3>
            <p>When you register it is absolutely neccessary for you to input a phone number and
                email. The phone number will help us in the future in case that something which 
                is beyond our authority happens. The number gets identified and authorities with 
                higher power deal with the case.
