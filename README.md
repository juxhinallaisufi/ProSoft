  # ***HelpMe Project*** 

We are creating this project to help people and also make the process of hiring employees easier and more comfortable. Nowadays, hiring or getting a job can be very difficult. There are a lot of procedures to do, in order to get to actually start working in a company, and these procedures, also are exhausting and tiring for the employer. Many different employers require many tests to be done from the applying employee in order to validate their abilities and skills. Our project focuses on making the hiring process more comfortable for both the employer and the applying employee. But, besides from hiring, our project also focuses on services. Simple services that are required by normal citizens, for which they are willing to pay. These services can be done by anyone, the only requirement is to have the ability to successfully complete the required service.

### *What is the purpose of HelpMe Project?*
HelpMe will serve as a web page in which people can register and can be both an employee (the person who performs the services and jobs) and the client (the person who requests services and jobs). The aim of our project is to make the process of earning money for people, a lot more comfortable, and providing individuals services , which they are not capable of performing themselves. 

##### *Some of the techniques that will be used in the project :*
-Posting a service<br/>
-Applying for services, or denying/accepting the service application from employees<br/>
-Showing the location of the user<br/>
-Messaging the client/employee for more information regarding the service/job<br/>
-Online payment etc...
